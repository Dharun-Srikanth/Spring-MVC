<h1>Spring-MVC</h1>
 
1. We used MySQL, MVC, and JSP pages to develop the login and registration pages as well as the welcome page in this project.
2. Made the project's Login, Student, and User models, as well as a DbConnect class to house any database-related functionality.
3. Business logic for storing the login and registration information in the MySQL database was written in the AuthDAO, HomeDAO, and RegisterDAO.
The login page's index.jsp
To access the registration page, use 5.Register.jsp.
The user's information is displayed on the home page, 6.Home.jsp.
